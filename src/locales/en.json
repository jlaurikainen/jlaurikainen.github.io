    "p1": "I qualified as an engineer in the spring of 2018, majoring in Mediatechnology. I've had a passion, even from a young age, for visualisation and front-end technologies. My greatest strengths lie in user interface design and 3d-modeling. That doesn't mean I avoid coding however, and infact I have familiarized myself with different front- and back-end frameworks even outside my studies.",
    "p2": "I'm interested in combining technology and visualisation into something that is usable for the end user. I'm always learning new things and I try to understand all aspects of technologies so that I might apply my existing experience in all new situations. Challenges keep me motivated."
